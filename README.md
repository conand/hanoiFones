iCTF 2015 challenge.

Run `make` to create a bundle you can sumbit.


Files
=====

  - `service/`: the service meat -- only these files get on the VM and are seen by players, put in everything that is needed!
  - `scripts/`: benign functionality for your service (flag setting / retrieval), and exploit samples.
  - `src/`: submit this as your source (note: this is just for organizers' reference).
